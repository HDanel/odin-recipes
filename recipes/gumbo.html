    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Whether it's on cold nights or any occasion, a warm bowl of gumbo always hits
        the spot. There are hundreds of different gumbo recipes throughout the history
        of Louisiana, but two main styles persist through today as synonymous with the dish. 
        Chicken and Sausage Gumbo and Seafood Gumbo. This recipe is devoted for the former
        as a staple of gumbo served all across southern Louisiana, but especially in
        the plains area.
