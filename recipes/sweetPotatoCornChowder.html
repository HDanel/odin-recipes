    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon corn oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package frozen corn kernels, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon corn oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups finely diced celery</li>
        <li>1 cup diced red onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup shallot, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 potato, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the sweet potatoes into a 9x13 inch baking dish, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of corn oil, and season with salt and pepper. Stir to coat the sweet potatoes in oil.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until the sweet potatoes are golden and tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir occasionally as they cook so the sweet potatoes cook evenly.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, measure out 1 cup of corn kernels and set aside. Place the remaining corn into a blender, and puree with the water until smooth; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of corn oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the celery, onion, and shallot. Cook and stir until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and dried thyme leaves; cook 1 minute more. Pour in the vegetable broth, corn puree, bay leaf, salt, and cubed potato. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potato is tender, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the potato is tender, remove and discard the bay leaf. Stir in the whole corn kernels, sweet potato, and chopped parsley. Return to a simmer and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving.</li>
    </ol>
